# Penetration Testing Holy Bible

  
This notepad includes various tips & tricks related to Penetration Testing. The goal of this pad is to include all tips and tricks found while playing with discovered vulnerabilities and CTFs challenges.

For some sections, a cheatsheet page includes all useful commands and references to tools and resources related to the chapter topic. Most of the things present in this pad are issued from other resources that I will reference along this work.
